Agents work in a continuous cycle of: thinking (Thought) → acting (Act) and observing (Observe).




Thought: The LLM part of the Agent decides what the next step should be.

Action: The agent takes an action, by calling the tools with the associated arguments.

Observation: The model reflects on the response from the tool.

The Thought-Action-Observation Cycle ---

The three components work together in a continuous loop. To use an analogy from programming, the agent uses a while loop: the loop continues until the objective of the agent has been fulfilled.

In many Agent frameworks, the rules and guidelines are embedded directly into the system prompt, ensuring that every cycle adheres to a defined logic.

In a simplified version, our system prompt.

We see here that in the System Message we defined :

The Agent’s behavior.
The Tools our Agent has access to, as we described in the previous section.
The Thought-Action-Observation Cycle, that we bake into the LLM instructions.

 Thought : 

 Upon receiving the query, Agent internal dialogue might be:

“The user needs current weather information for New York. I have access to a tool that fetches weather data. First, I need to call the weather API to get up-to-date details.”

This step shows the agent breaking the problem into steps: first, gathering the necessary data.

 Action:

 Tool Usage:

 Based on its reasoning and the fact that agent knows about a get_weather tool, Agent prepares a JSON-formatted command that calls the weather API tool. For example, its first action could be:

Thought: I need to check the current weather for New York.

   {
     "action": "get_weather",
     "action_input": {
       "location": "New York"
     }
   }


  Observation:

Feedback from the Environment:

After the tool call, Agent receives an observation. This might be the raw weather data from the API such as: “Current weather in New York: partly cloudy, 15°C, 60% humidity.”

This observation is then added to the prompt as additional context. It functions as real-world feedback, confirming whether the action succeeded and providing the needed details.

Updated thought
Reflecting:

With the observation in hand, Agent updates its internal reasoning:
“Now that I have the weather data for New York, I can compile an answer for the user.”


 Final Action
Agent then generates a final response formatted as we told it to:

Thought: I have the weather data now. The current weather in New York is partly cloudy with a temperature of 15°C and 60% humidity.”

Final answer : The current weather in New York is partly cloudy with a temperature of 15°C and 60% humidity.

This final action sends the answer back to the user, closing the loop.
